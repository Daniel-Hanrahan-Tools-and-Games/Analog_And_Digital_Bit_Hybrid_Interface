# Analog_And_Digital_Bit_Hybrid_Interface
A software interface where hardware can use Optical Analog/Digital hybrid random access memory

If you are going to use this with a Raspberry Pi with ADC then you will need the ADC driver.

If you are going to use this with an Arduino then you will need the Arduino driver.

You may want to run the tasks you want to do more than once because this type of hardware has not been perfected yet.

To run this application in your browser you will want to put the contents of the Analog_And_Digital_Bit_Hybrid_Interface version 1.2 folder in your web server directory and you will need a web server to run this application in your browser.

To build a Analog/Digital Hybrid bit of ram you take a laser diode and aim it at a photoresistor.
